# Intro to Operating Systems

- **The Von Neumann Model of Computing**
  - Fetch
  - Decode
  - Execute
- **Virtualization**
- OS is a _resource manager_
- _Virtualizing the CPU_
  - turn a single CPU into multiple CPUs
  - governed by _policies_
- Use `&` to allow multiple jobs to run _in the background_
- Memory is accessed on _each_ instruction fetch
- OS also virtualizes memory
- Each process accesses its own private **virtual address space**
  - where OS maps to physical memory
